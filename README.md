Requirements Python 3.4

Its just a simple script that indents SQF Code..

cd \<path to sqf files\>  
C:\Python34\Python.exe  \<path to sqf-indenter\>/sqfIndentor.py

The script will parse all *.sqf in current directory + create new files with -new added to the filename.

Still needs a small bit of work, but its pretty good.
Really it just needs to recode it so easier for people alter the rules for indentation.

As side bonus it is pretty decent at de-obfuscating SQF Code aswell.
